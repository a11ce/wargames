<h2 id="turn-structure">Turn Structure</h2>
<p><strong>Full turns</strong>. Players alternate taking complete turns. A complete turn can mean activating every unit or some set/rolled number. <em>E.g. XCom</em></p>
<p><strong>Phases</strong>. Players take actions until failing an action (or on another condition), at which point another player gains the phase. <em>E.g. Crossfire, RiftWar</em></p>
<p><strong>Interleaved</strong>. Within one turn, players alternate activating units. This can be in steps, e.g. players alternate movement then alternate firing. <em>E.g. BattleTech</em></p>
<p><strong>Initiative</strong>. A die is rolled for each unit (once or per turn), and they are activated in sorted order. May include initiative manipulation. <em>E.g. D&amp;D, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</em></p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous</strong>. Both players decide on their action then reveal them at the same time. They can take effect at the same time or use some other ordering mechanism. <em>E.g. Pokemon (the video game), Diplomacy</em></p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong>. Each unit (or side) has a track on a shared global timeline. Actions have different time costs (their tokens are different lengths). Whenever the current time reaches the end of an action that player chooses the next action for the track. <em>E.g. YOMI Hustle (kind of?), I would love to see an actual wargame with this setup</em></p>
<p><strong>Ordered Steps</strong>. Within a turn, units take actions in a specific order (e.g. move then fire). Can be individually-ordered (unit A moves then fires, then unit B moves then fires) or totally (all units move, then all units fire). <em>E.g. XCom, BattleTech</em></p>
<p><strong>Action Points</strong>. Within a turn, a player has some number of points to spend on actions with different costs. Also subject to other restrictions (max points used on one unit, firing must be last, &amp;c). Can also be per unit in an interleaved/initiative system. <em>E.g. Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</em></p>
