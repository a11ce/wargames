<h2 id="pax-centralis">Pax Centralis</h2>
<p>The Pax Centralis is a mutual military and economic assistance treaty of four polities located on the continent of Santerra. Its combined territory reaches to the eastern and western shores, and includes several eastern islands.</p>
<p>It is governed by a Council of one representative from each polity, whose appointments rotate every two years. They are the Sovereigns of Diplomacy, Industry, Culture, and State.</p>
<h3 id="zhong-territories">Zhong Territories</h3>
<p>The landlocked Zhong Territories provide much of the food to the Pax. They are generally isolated from international affairs. When called to war, they field ranger bands made up of hunters and local armed police.</p>
<h3 id="tilia">Tilia</h3>
<p>To the east, the great plains of Tilia stretch to the shore. While mostly consisting of uninhabited prairie, residents of the dense coastal cities of Tilia are responsible for central production planning, maritime trade, and enacting the decrees of the Council. Tilia also operates extensive supply lines connecting the west to commercial ports.</p>
<h3 id="ercos">Ercos</h3>
<p>Ercos appears to most Pax citizens only as its border wall, an impossibly long cliff of iron stretching from the northwest to the southwest corner of the Zhong territories, and curving into the sea at each side. Off the western shore, massive ice sheets prevent any entry by sea and send frigid winds into Ercos. It is speculated that the border wall was created in part as an artificial mountain to further lower the temperature in order to maximize industrial and human efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="the-kingdom-of-liara">The Kingdom of Liara</h3>
<p>The northern territories of the Pax are administered by the feudal Kingdom of Liara. No longer immediately concerned with food, heavy industry, or trade, Liara has developed into a highly stratified society with most human effort used to create large-scale works of art and monument at the direction of the resource-controlling artisan class.</p>

<h2 id="bug-nato">Bug NATO</h2>
<p>Bug NATO is from the Bug Dimension. They are in practice identical to European NATO forces circa 1990. To date, they have appeared as mechanized or airborne infantry squads. These consist of 8 riflebugs (one of whom is the squad commander) and an ATGM or other heavy weapon, all carried in two IFVs or transport helicopters.</p>
